# Mechanisms_Calculator
My first project in Java, creating a calculator for mechanical mechanisms and motor sizing

## Basics Concepts

In the Engineering area, normally, we deal with mechanical conversions for many types of mechanisms. For example, to convert the rotary movement from a motor to a linear axis of a robot, we can use a ball screw mechanism or a rack and pinion.

Each mechanism has an individual purpose, and many times, the type of mechanism can change the system stability. for this reason, an easy calculator is a good option to help designers in their tasks, like: speed convertion, inertia ratio and torque calculation, units changing, etc...

This calculator was created by me, to help anyone and itÂ´s my first job using JAVA and POO. I hope you enjoy it!
